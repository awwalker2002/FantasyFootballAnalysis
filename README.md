# FantasyFootballAnalysis
* Goal is to create an application where users can input their Sleeper (fantasy football platform) username, and the application will pull up their team(s)/league(s) info and provide information such as start/sit recommendations, trade analysis, etc.
* Will use player data collected from [Fantasy Pros](https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/rankings/ros-overall.php) and [ProFootballReference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2023/fantasy.htm).
* Will use [Sleeper API](https://docs.sleeper.com/) to pull all user info, including the leagues they are in, all team rosters in those leagues, league standings, points scored, etc.
