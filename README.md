# HospitalSimulation
Goal is to simulate the ICU (or some other unit) of a hospital and try to optimize staffing in terms of patient outcomes and cost.
Will use data from an Israeli hospital to establish the parameters for the simulation.
Will use a Python package called SimPy for the simulation, which is a discrete-event simulation framework.
